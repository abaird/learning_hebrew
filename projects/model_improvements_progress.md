## Current Progress Notes

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 (Authorization with Pundit)
**Completed**: Phases 1-3 successfully implemented with comprehensive test fixes
**Next Steps**:
1. Install Pundit gem for authorization
2. Create authorization policies for superuser vs regular user access
3. Update controllers with authorization checks
4. Write comprehensive policy tests
5. Ensure all tests pass

**Major Achievement**: Successfully transformed database schema from hierarchical to many-to-many relationships while maintaining all functionality. Fixed 32 test failures and achieved 0 failures across 111 examples.

## Manual Testing Required
After each phase completion, manual testing required before commit/push:
- [x] Phase 1: Verify database schema and associations ✅
- [x] Phase 2: Test model relationships in Rails console ✅
- [x] Phase 3: Test superuser creation and functionality ✅
- [ ] Phase 4: Test authorization across different user types
- [ ] Phase 5: Test form UI with dropdowns and checkboxes
- [ ] Phase 6: Test navigation and authentication flow
- [ ] Phase 7: Review test coverage reports
- [ ] Phase 8: Test deployment configuration

## Commits and Deployment
**Commit Strategy**: One commit per completed phase after manual testing approval
**Phases Committed**: Phases 1-3 ("Implement Phase 3: Superuser functionality and fix test suite")
**Next Commit**: Phase 4 completion (pending)
