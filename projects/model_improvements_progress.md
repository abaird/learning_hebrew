## Current Progress Notes

**Current Phase**: Phase 7 (Testing Updates) - Most tests already complete
**Completed**: Phases 1-6 successfully implemented with comprehensive test coverage
**Next Steps**:
1. Review test coverage reports (Phase 7)
2. Update documentation (Phase 8)
3. Verify deployment configuration (Phase 8)

**Major Achievements**:
- Successfully transformed database schema from hierarchical to many-to-many relationships
- Implemented full Pundit authorization system with role-based access control
- Created modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and custom navigation
- Achieved comprehensive test coverage: 197 examples, 0 failures

## Infrastructure and Security Improvements

### Database Security Enhancements ✅
**Status**: Completed during Phase 5
**Issues Resolved**:
- **Hardcoded passwords**: Removed DATABASE_URL with embedded credentials from Kubernetes manifests
- **Insecure configuration**: Fixed database.yml to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
- **Inconsistent authentication**: Resolved conflicts between DATABASE_URL and individual environment variables
- **Deployment authentication failures**: Fixed postgres authentication issues in Kubernetes cluster

**Security Improvements Made**:
- Updated `config/database.yml` to use `ENV.fetch("POSTGRES_USER")` and `ENV.fetch("POSTGRES_PASSWORD")`
- Removed hardcoded `DATABASE_URL` from `k8s/rails-app.yaml` and `k8s/local/rails-app-local.yaml`
- Configured Rails to use individual environment variables from Kubernetes secrets
- Ensured all credentials are now sourced from `app-secrets` secret in Kubernetes
- Verified password rotation capability without code changes

### Deployment Configuration Fixes ✅
**Status**: Completed
**Issues Resolved**:
- **Seeds not running**: Init container was only running `db:migrate`, not `db:seed`
- **Superuser missing**: Database seeds weren't being executed during deployment
- **Fresh cluster setup**: PVC persistence was causing authentication conflicts with old data

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `k8s/local/rails-app-local.yaml` init container command to `["bin/rails", "db:migrate", "db:seed"]`
- Verified superuser creation process works correctly with environment-specific passwords
- Documented process for fresh cluster deployment with proper credential setup
- Confirmed database functionality with proper secret-based authentication

## Manual Testing Required
After each phase completion, manual testing required before commit/push:
- [x] Phase 1: Verify database schema and associations ✅
- [x] Phase 2: Test model relationships in Rails console ✅
- [x] Phase 3: Test superuser creation and functionality ✅
- [x] Phase 4: Test authorization across different user types ✅
- [x] Phase 5: Test form UI with dropdowns and checkboxes ✅
- [x] Phase 6: Test navigation and authentication flow ✅
- [ ] Phase 7: Review test coverage reports
- [ ] Phase 8: Test deployment configuration
